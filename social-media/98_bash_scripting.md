The video has been posted for: **[Intro to Bash Scripting](https://youtu.be/1pQ527fGhVQ)**

Speaker: Rebecca BurWei, Data Scientist at Mozilla

The links to the slides and the sample bash files to follow along are in the video description.

This talk is for all of us who feel like we never learned Bash properly. The goal is to increase our self-sufficiency in writing Bash. We'll start with some basic Bash commands, but move quickly to combining commands, scripting, error handling and resources for teaching yourself more.

Audience: This should interest folks working in DevOps or developers doing repetitive file tasks as well as in cybersecurity and more.
