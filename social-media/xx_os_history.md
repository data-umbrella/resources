Anyone who is a user of open source software. This is particularly interesting to developers and people who code in any language.

:question:WHY is it relevant:
This presentation covered a quick history of Open Source, from the beginnings of its precursor, the Free Software movement in the 1980s until the present day. It covers important milestones in the development of Open Source within their historical context, and it concludes with some ideas about post-open source.
