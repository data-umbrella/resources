- LLMs = Large Language Models

A link to the **slides** is included in the video description.

LLMs have changed what it means to "do natural language processing", opening up the fields to newcomers and beginners. This talk presents some traditional NLP tasks and how they can be fielded using prompting and tools such as GPT-4. Discussion of open source tools (like OpenChatKit) is also included.
