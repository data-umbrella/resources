Sharing here a resource of interest: video for **[Intro to OpenRefine for Data Cleaning and Reconciliation](https://youtu.be/e9fB8NQV6Nc)**.

A link to the **slides** is included in the video description.

OpenRefine stands as a robust, open-source tool specifically tailored for those delving into the complex world of messy data. It is designed to not only cleanse such data but also to transform it, making it easier to convert between varying formats.

Presentation covers: intro to OpenRefine, exploring its purpose, its user base, and its historical evolution with a demo. It includes downloading, installing, data imports, the nuances of filtering and faceting, clustering, as well as vital data cleaning techniques, and the application of reconciliation services. 

Finally, the session culminates in an invitation to participants to join the OpenRefine community, shedding light on various avenues through which they can contribute â€“ be it through coding, design, translation, documentation enhancement, or user support.

NOTE: Educators: this is a great tool to introduce to students on cleaning data in spreadsheets as well as text data.
