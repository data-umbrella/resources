Video: [R vs Python for Data Science](https://youtu.be/5c4cb6kvJGE)

A link to the **slides** is included in the video description.

This talk will introduce Python users to the R ecosystem. Attendees should expect that by the end of the talk they will understand how to get started with reporting infrastructure in Python and R; and how to use open standards to share data across data products. As part of the discussion, we will see different use cases for both languages, their integration, and common pitfalls.

NOTE: There are detailed timestamps to see the full topics and packages covered in this presentation.
