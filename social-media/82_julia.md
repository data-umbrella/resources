**About:**  
Julia is a high-level, general-purpose dynamic programming language. Its features are well suited for numerical analysis and computational science. If you have experience programming in another language, you will find that most of your knowledge will be easily transferred to Julia. Refer to the documentation of some [noteworthy differences](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/noteworthy-differences/) from other popular languages: [Matlab](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/noteworthy-differences/#Noteworthy-differences-from-MATLAB), [R](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/noteworthy-differences/#Noteworthy-differences-from-R), [Python](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/noteworthy-differences/#Noteworthy-differences-from-Python-1) and [C/C++](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/noteworthy-differences/#Noteworthy-differences-from-C/C).

Flux is an elegant approach to machine learning. It's a 100% pure-Julia stack, and provides lightweight abstractions on top of Julia's native GPU and AD support. Flux makes the easy things easy while remaining fully hackable. Learn about the basics of machine learning with FluxML in Julia, how it differs from other frameworks, and why it matters.

This presentation will introduce the basics of machine learning with FluxML in Julia, how it differs from other frameworks, and why it matters.
